# Global Auth - Backend Integration Skill

This skill covers backend integration with TxGlobalAuth — specifically JWT token validation, session data extraction, and anti-patterns that lead to broken integrations.

**Note**: TxGlobalAuth is a frontend widget. There is no backend SDK. Backend integration consists of validating JWTs issued by the widget and extracting user data from them.

**Source of truth for data structures**: Generated Go code from proto definitions lives in the Kratos repository at `globalauth/protobuf/modules/proto/`. The original `.proto` source files are maintained in a separate internal proto repository — the generated `.pb.go` files reference their source paths (e.g. `proto/common/person.proto`). Key generated files:
- `common/person/person.pb.go` — Person message (source: `proto/common/person.proto`)
- `txauth/common/session/session.pb.go` — Session, EdoxFirm, UserType (source: `proto/txauth/common/session/session.proto`)
- `txauth/common/provider/provider.pb.go` — AuthSource, AuthProvider (source: `proto/txauth/common/provider/provider.proto`)

## Token Validation — Required

**Every backend that receives a TxGlobalAuth JWT must validate it.** Never trust a token without validation — the frontend is an untrusted environment.

There are two approaches to validation:

### Approach 1: TxAuth Agent (Token Introspection)

Send the token to the TxAuth agent service for validation and session data extraction.

*Technical details: TBD — consult your infrastructure team for the agent endpoint URL and request format.*

### Approach 2: Kratos JWT Introspection

Validate the token through the Kratos JWT introspection endpoint.

*Technical details: TBD — consult your infrastructure team for the endpoint and required headers.*

Both approaches validate the token signature and expiration, and return the decoded session data including `person`.

## JWT Structure — What the Token Actually Contains

### Top-Level Claims

All TxGlobalAuth JWTs share the same top-level claim structure regardless of provider:

```
area, parent, scontext, zipped, created, renewExp, sess, iss,
keyId, firebase, secrets, provider, scope, tstep, spinReq, exp, spinExp, jti
```

**There is no `email`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `sub`, or `user_id` at the top level.** This is not a standard OIDC token. User data lives inside the `sess` field.

Key top-level claims:
- `provider` — provider name string (e.g. `"AD_OFFICE"`, `"KRATOS"`, or a product-specific L2 provider name)
- `scontext` — session context with provider config, token type, expiration settings
- `scope` — token scope (may be empty `{}` for L1, may contain content flags for L2)
- `firebase` — nested Firebase JWT (present for AD and Kratos L1, empty string for L2)
- `zipped` — always `true`, indicates `sess` is gzip-compressed

### The `sess` Field Is a Compressed JSON Object

The JWT has `"zipped": true` — the `sess` payload is gzip-compressed. When you decode the JWT on the backend (e.g., `jwt.decode()` in Node.js), the `sess` field appears as a binary/base64 blob, **not** as a structured object.

**Do not attempt to read `sess` fields without decompression.** Use one of the validation approaches above — they handle decompression and return structured data.

### The `firebase` Field Is a Nested JWT

The `firebase` claim contains a separate Firebase JWT. When present (non-empty), its only useful field is `uid`, which equals `person.id`. Present for AD and Kratos L1 tokens, empty string for L2 tokens.

## Session Structure by Token Type

The decompressed `sess` object varies significantly between provider types and authentication levels. **Do not assume all fields are always present — most fields outside of `person.id` are optional and may be absent depending on the provider and auth level.**

### AD Tokens (`AD_OFFICE`, `AD_OFFICE_OTP`, `AD_OFFICE_SMS`, `AD_WTE`)

```json
{
    "person": {
        "id": "55ca4536-...",
        "name": "John",
        "lastname": "Doe",
        "middlename": "...",
        "email": "jdoe@corp.example.com",
        "login": "jdoe"
    },
    "userType": "EMPLOYEE_USER_TYPE"
}
```

- `person.id` — LDAP/AD GUID (likely objectGUID). **Not a Kratos ID.**
- `person.kratosId` — absent
- `person` fields — typically rich (name, lastname, email, login). Exact set may vary across AD configurations.
- `userType` — `"EMPLOYEE_USER_TYPE"`
- No `permissions`, `firms`, `segments`, or trading-related data

AD provider variants:
- `AD_OFFICE` — standard AD (username + password)
- `AD_OFFICE_OTP` — AD with OTP as second factor
- `AD_OFFICE_SMS` — AD with SMS as second factor
- `AD_WTE` — separate domain controller (no 2FA at this time)

### Kratos L1 Tokens (`KRATOS` and similar L1 providers)

```json
{
    "person": {
        "id": "e9b9aba4-...",
        "email": "user@example.com",
        "kratosId": "e9b9aba4-..."
    },
    "permissions": [ ... ],
    "segments": ["employees"],
    "subscriptionTariff": "PRO"
}
```

- `person.id` **equals** `person.kratosId` — both are the Kratos identity UUID
- `person` fields — **minimal**: often only `id`, `email`, `kratosId`. Name, lastname, login, phone may be **absent**.
- `userType` — may be absent
- `permissions`, `segments`, `subscriptionTariff` — may be present

Multiple L1 provider names exist depending on product configuration and region. All share the same session structure.

### Kratos L2 Tokens (product- and region-specific L2 providers)

```json
{
    "person": {
        "id": "4337d6dc-...",
        "name": "John",
        "lastname": "Doe",
        "middlename": "...",
        "email": "user@example.com",
        "login": "jdoe",
        "verifiedPhone": "+1(312) 555-0690",
        "kratosId": "e9b9aba4-..."
    },
    "userType": "COMMON_USER_TYPE",
    "authenticationId": "123249",
    "permissions": [ ... ],
    "firms": [
        { "id": 1, "ratingLegacy": "...", "managerId": "176786", "manager": "..." }
    ],
    "crmId": "156cd68c-...",
    "edoxVerified": true,
    "segments": ["employees"],
    "subscriptionTariff": "PRO"
}
```

- `person.id` **differs from** `person.kratosId` — `id` is a trading/client account identifier, `kratosId` is the Kratos identity UUID
- `person` fields — rich (name, lastname, email, login, phone, middlename)
- `userType` — `"COMMON_USER_TYPE"` for regular clients
- `firms` — EDOX firm associations (trading accounts)
- `authenticationId`, `crmId`, `edoxVerified` — trading/client account metadata
- L2 providers require 2FA — `scontext.provider.tfaRequired` is a **provider-level configuration flag** meaning "this provider requires 2FA". It is not a token state. If you receive a valid L2 token, 2FA has already been completed — the widget does not issue L2 tokens until 2FA passes.

Multiple L2 provider names exist depending on product and region. All share the same session structure.

### person.id Semantics — Critical

**The meaning of `person.id` changes depending on the provider:**

| Provider Type | `person.id` | `person.kratosId` |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| AD | LDAP/AD GUID | absent |
| Kratos L1 | = kratosId (same value) | Kratos UUID |
| Kratos L2 | Trading/client account ID | Kratos UUID |

**`person.kratosId` is the stable user identity** across authentication levels. Think of it as the primary identity — everyone who authenticates through Kratos gets one. `person.id` in L2 is a secondary identifier (trading account) that the user acquires when they become a client. For AD users, `person.id` (AD GUID) is the only identifier since they exist outside the Kratos identity system.

When correlating users across sessions or linking to internal databases:
- For Kratos users (L1 and L2) — use `person.kratosId` as the stable identity. `person.id` may change between L1 and L2 for the same user.
- For AD users — use `person.id` (the AD GUID). These users don't have a `kratosId`.

## Anti-Patterns

### `sess` Is NOT a Kratos Session Token

**Wrong**: Sending `sess` to Kratos `/sessions/whoami` endpoint as a session token.

`sess` is a compressed JSON object containing the full session with person data. It is not a Kratos session identifier. Sending it to whoami will fail or return unexpected results.

### Do NOT Parse JWT Claims for User Data

**Wrong**: Decoding the JWT and looking for `email`, `first_name`, `sub`, or similar standard claims at the top level.

TxGlobalAuth JWTs do not follow standard OIDC claim naming. User data is inside `sess.person` (compressed). Use the validation service to extract it.

### Do NOT Assume Session Fields Are Always Present

**Wrong**: Accessing `sess.person.name`, `sess.userType`, `sess.firms`, etc. without checking if they exist.

The session structure varies dramatically by provider and auth level. Kratos L1 tokens may contain only `person.id`, `person.email`, and `person.kratosId` — with no name, lastname, login, phone, userType, firms, or other fields. Always treat every field except `person.id` as optional.

### Do NOT Use person.id as a Stable Cross-Level Identifier

**Wrong**: Storing `person.id` from an L1 token and expecting it to match `person.id` from an L2 token.

For the same user, `person.id` in L1 equals their kratosId, but `person.id` in L2 may be a different identifier (trading account). Use `person.kratosId` as the stable identity.

### Do NOT Rely on Kratos whoami as Primary Data Source

The Kratos whoami endpoint (`/sessions/whoami`) may be unreachable from your backend due to:
- IP filtering (Docker containers, cloud environments, non-VPN networks)
- Geographic restrictions
- Session token format mismatches

Use whoami only as a supplementary check, not as the primary source of user data. The token validation approaches above are the reliable path.

### Do NOT Skip Validation for "Trusted" Frontends

Even in internal enterprise applications, always validate the JWT. The token arrives from the browser — it can be tampered with, replayed, or expired. Validation is not optional.

## Receiving Data from the Frontend

The frontend widget decodes the compressed `sess` field client-side and provides structured `session.person` data in its callbacks (see `global-auth:frontend` skill).

For **non-critical display data** (names, email for UI display), the frontend may pass `session.person` fields alongside the token for convenience. This is acceptable because:
- The token itself is validated independently on the backend
- Display fields like name/lastname are not used for authorization decisions
- The widget has already decompressed the data client-side

For **authorization decisions** (permissions, access control, user identity), always extract data from the validated token on the backend side.

## Data Not Available from TxGlobalAuth

Regardless of provider type, the following are **never** included in TxGlobalAuth tokens:
- Job title / position
- Department / organizational unit
- Office location
- Manager hierarchy
- Employee expertise / skills

These require direct LDAP/AD queries or separate HR system integration on the backend.
